### Summary

I'm a seasoned Software Engineer and work preferably with Ruby on Rails & Docker. Although I'm proficient on the front-end of a typical web application, I've been focusing on the server-side in the last two years. I did lots of work related to APIs, refactoring and extracting (micro)-services out of monolithic Rails apps.

I lived & worked on three continents (Europe, Australia and Asia) and was involved in shaping the local tech-community in Saigon, Vietnam by organizing Ruby & Docker meetups.

## Employment history

### Freelance Software Engineer at [XING](http://xing.com) (2015 - present)

XING, the social network for business professionals, has around 9 million members in its core German-speaking market. The organizational structure of XING evolves around product teams, and I was hired as part of the Communities team, which is responsible for the Groups product.

Besides from the ongoing development, my primary responsibility was building a new product, the Groups Marketplace. The main purpose is, to free up discussions from classifieds and job ads, as well as making this data available to XING in a structured way.

Achievements include:

 - Built and shipped the [Groups Marketplace](https://www.xing.com/communities/groups/bmw-freude-am-fahren-1004997/marketplace) with our team
 - Introduced Github pull-request workflow with codereviews.
 - Improved overall consistency of the codebase by advocating for commonly shared coding standards
 - Mentored junior developers through extensive pair programming

### Freelance Software Engineer at [Bulletproof](http://bulletproof.net) (2012 - 2015)

I mostly worked on internal and customer facing Ruby (on Rails) apps. We did a large refactoring in one of the main Rails applications, which paid off years of technical debt. This allowed us to start to extract micro services, build sane REST APIs and move faster in development overall.

In 2014, we were onboarding more Ruby developers and I became the de facto Ruby dev-lead. Besides from that, I had the chance to spend a significant amount of time in research on Docker and its ecosystem, with the goal to build an internal Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Achievements included:

 - Paid off 10 years of technical debt in the CRM app
 - Shaped development best practices for the team
 - Research project on viability of Docker PaaS for Bulletproof

### Software Engineer at [Ennova](http://ennova.com.au) (2012 - 2012)

First stop in Australia, where I had the pleasure to do lots of pair programming on client projects and Ennova's SaaS for the mining industry. All work was Ruby related and mostly deployed to Heroku.

### Freelance Software Engineer at [Maritime Data Systems](http://www.maritimedatasystems.com) (2012 - 2012)

We built an app for real time monitoring of the commercial traffic in the Port of Hamburg. The data feed was provided by the Hamburg Port Authority and we processed and enriched the data.

The end users were tug boat companies, who use this tool for acquiring new customers up until today.


### Freelance Software Engineer at [9Flats](http://www.9flats.com) (2011 - 2011)

The scope of the project was, to use geo data to enrich the listing of the platform with meaningful content, make it easy to internationalize and perform SEO based on geographical features.

### Software Engineer at [tmp8](http://tmp8.de) (2010 - 2011)

As part of this small software consultancy, I was working on projects in various companies. We built tools for offline media tracking / tagging (newspapers / magazines), SEO optimization and a sport community platform for Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund (German Olympic Sports Confederation).

### Software Engineer at [Ubilabs](http://ubilabs.net) (2010 - 2010)

Besides from some smaller projects, I was working on two major projects during my time here:

Blitzer.de

A platform to report stationary and mobile speed traps in Europe. The collected data is consumed by mobile clients and GPS navigation systems. I was involved in maintaining the website, developing new features and building up the geo database to perform better SEO.

Guided.by

Targeted to travellers, this project enabled them to collaboratively create travel guides with their friends for destinations they're planning to visit. We built the project from scratch, including a geo database and connecting it to various travel platform APIs.
