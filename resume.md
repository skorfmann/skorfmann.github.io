## Project history

### Freelance Software Engineer at [Wer liefert was?](https://www.wlw.de) (2018 - present)

Initially hired for a Ruby on Rails performance optimization project, I was offered the opportunity to join a cloud migration task force subsequently. Its goal is: Moving the web application stack with about 30 microservices to Amazon Web Services.

Achievements include:

- Making a business case to successfully convince the upper management and C-level to support the cloud migration project beyond the proof of concept
- Hybrid on premise / cloud setup with deep integration into developer tooling and workflows
- Fully codified / modularized cloud infrastructure leveraging Terraform in a GitOps workflow
- Shutdown of on premise web stack in Q3/2019

### Freelance Software Engineer at [XING](https://www.xing.com) (2015 - 2018)

XING, the social network for business professionals, has around 15 million members in its core German-speaking market.

#### Xing Profile (2016 - 2018)

The goal of this project was to modularize the Profile application in a way, that other teams at Xing could be empowered to contribute widgets to enhance the core profile data with content like "contacts", "events" or "activities". The highlevel purpose - besides from modernizing the technology stack - was an increase of user engagement.

Achievements include:

- Successfully pioneered and evangelized the first GraphQL based product at Xing which served as foundation for the entire platform
- Fixed millions of profile data inconsistencies
- Re-architected the core profile data services to improve encapsulation and pay off technical debt
- Stakeholder management for the various touchpoints across the company at management and director level

#### Xing Communities / Ad Manager (2015 - 2016)

Besides from the ongoing development, my primary responsibility was building a new product, the Groups Marketplace. The main purpose is, to free up discussions from classifieds and job ads, as well as making this data available to XING in a structured way.

Starting from 2016 I became the interim Lead Developer of that team and we shifted the focus towards the "XING Ad Manager" product, which is a self booking tool for XING members to promote their content across the XING platform.

Achievements include:

- Built and shipped the [Groups Marketplace](https://www.xing.com/communities/groups/bmw-freude-am-fahren-1004997/marketplace) with our team
- Improved overall consistency of the codebase by advocating for commonly shared coding standards
- Mentored junior developers through extensive pair programming
- Guided the team through a product change

### Freelance Software Engineer at [Bulletproof](http://bulletproof.net) (2012 - 2015)

I mostly worked on internal and customer facing Ruby (on Rails) apps. We did a large refactoring in one of the main Rails applications, which paid off years of technical debt. This allowed us to start to extract micro services, build sane REST APIs and move faster in development overall.

In 2014, we were onboarding more Ruby developers and I became the Ruby dev-lead. Besides from that, I had the chance to spend a significant amount of time in research on Docker and its ecosystem, with the goal to build an internal Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Achievements included:

- Paid off 10 years of technical debt in the CRM app
- Shaped development best practices for the team
- Research project on viability of Docker PaaS for Bulletproof

### Software Engineer at [Ennova](http://ennova.com.au) (2012 - 2012)

First stop in Australia, where I had the pleasure to do lots of pair programming on client projects and Ennova's SaaS for the mining industry. All work was Ruby related and mostly deployed to Heroku.

### Freelance Software Engineer at [Maritime Data Systems](http://www.maritimedatasystems.com) (2012 - 2012)

We built an app for real time monitoring of the commercial traffic in the Port of Hamburg. The data feed was provided by the Hamburg Port Authority and we processed and enriched the data.

The end users were tug boat companies, who use this tool for acquiring new customers up until today.

### Freelance Software Engineer at [9Flats](http://www.9flats.com) (2011 - 2011)

The scope of the project was, to use geo data to enrich the listing of the platform with meaningful content, make it easy to internationalize and perform SEO based on geographical features.

### Software Engineer at [tmp8](http://tmp8.de) (2010 - 2011)

As part of this small software consultancy, I was working on projects in various companies. We built tools for offline media tracking / tagging (newspapers / magazines), SEO optimization and a sport community platform for Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund (German Olympic Sports Confederation).

### Software Engineer at [Ubilabs](http://ubilabs.net) (2010 - 2010)

Besides from some smaller projects, I was working on two major projects during my time here:

Blitzer.de

A platform to report stationary and mobile speed traps in Europe. The collected data is consumed by mobile clients and GPS navigation systems. I was involved in maintaining the website, developing new features and building up the geo database to perform better SEO.

Guided.by

Targeted to travellers, this project enabled them to collaboratively create travel guides with their friends for destinations they're planning to visit. We built the project from scratch, including a geo database and connecting it to various travel platform APIs.
